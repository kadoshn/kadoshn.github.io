title: "Welcome To My Website!"

Hello, my name is Nicole Kadosh and I am a senior Mathematics Major with a concentration in Biology and Statistics Minor at Appalachian State University. This website is a glimps into my academic career and interests of my life. I was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and grew up in love with the beach. I have a younger sister and 3 puppers! When deciding where I wanted to go to college I wanted to experience seasons and a different environment, as I had never seen anything but "hot". Coming to Appalchian State has been everything I could have imagined and more! My college experience has taught me alot about myself and shapped my interests and goals in life. 


My favorite quote for a little laugh; *"a smile is like tight underwear - it makes your cheeks go up"*
